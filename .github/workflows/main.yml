name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the develop branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev # branch used for testing incremental builds
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev # branch used for testing incremental builds

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
